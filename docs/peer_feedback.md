# Peer Review Feedback

## Feedback from Braeden
1. **Interaction with spider plot**: *Rather than having a spider plot with
   fixed attributes to compare any two players, it would be better to have an
   interaction.* This is indeed a valuable feedback. Having a fixed set of
   attributes for spider plot will definitely restrict the user's interaction
   with our data. Rather than having fixed set of attributes, we will start
   the comparision with a default set of attributes. The user can then manually
   change any of the attributes to select attributes of his/her choice

2. **Add Percentile Information**: *Dewliver a relative position of a player
   w.r.t. all other in each of the attributes*. While depictiing ratings of
   the selected player, each rating will also have a *percentile* information.
   This would give the user a fair idea about how better the player is w.r.t.
   to each skill among all the players in our dataset.

3. **Add Seach option**: This idea has been further extended to have a search
   (filter) option for each of the attributes in the player list. Not only
   can a player search for a player, he can filter/search within any of the
   attributes in our list.
